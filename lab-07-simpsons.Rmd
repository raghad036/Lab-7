```{r whickham}
?Whickham
```

```

Your answer;
Ù‰obs 1314

3.  

```{r number_variables}
ncol(Whickham)
```

Your answer:3 var , "outcome" "smoker"  "age"  

```{r var_type}
unique(Whickham$outcome)
unique(Whickham$smoker)
unique(Whickham$age)
```

Your answer: 

```{r plot_outcome}
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = outcome)) +
  geom_bar()
```


```{r plot_smoker}
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = smoker)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r plot_age}
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


4. 

```{r plot_smokeVSincome_1}
ggplot(data=Whickham, aes(x=smoker, y=outcome, color=outcome)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
